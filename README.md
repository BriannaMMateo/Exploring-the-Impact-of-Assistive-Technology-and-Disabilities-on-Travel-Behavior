Assistive technology plays an integral role in improving the quality of travel people with disabilities face. Many people with disabilities are unwilling or less likely to travel since there is additional labor, whether financial, mental, or physical to utilize public transportation. Our research focused on how assistive technology influences the travel behavior of individuals and how income affects the use of assistive technology. Utilizing Chi-square tests and an analysis of variance (ANOVA), our key findings include: first, no statistically significant relationship between public transportation usage and assistive technology; second, a significant variation in total miles personally driven based on the type of assistive technology used; and third, a significant influence of income levels on individuals' choices of assistive technology. Our findings contribute to current literature by specifically concentrating on the role of assistive technology in enhancing the travel experience for individuals with disabilities.
